\section{Introduction}
The focus of this Thesis describes the development and integration of an educational Python-based adaptive programming game. This is intended to combine traditional game mechanics with programming components. Players control their progress by using their individual programming skills. The development also covers all work on the web application, focusing on the game elements and steps taken to mantain secure code execution. By reviewing existing approaches and implementing a prototype environment, this research evaluates the feasibility, scalability, and user-friendliness of such systems.

\subsection{Aims and Objectives} 
The main purpose of this thesis is to outline the work of game development on an educational tool, which is designed to teach Python programming. The game is intended to be a fun and engaging way to learn Python programming to be played by beginners and experienced programmers alike.  It should encourage and motivate students to learn Python and coding in particular. The way to make it fun and engaging is to use game elements such as levels, challenges, and rewards. The conceptualisation and design of such game elements will be explored in detail and how they should be implemented. Another exploration that will be made is the underlying mechanics of how code send by the player will be executed safely. The result of this project should be used to further develop the game-based learning project.
