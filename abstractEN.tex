\addsec{Abstract}
The integration of game-based learning in education has revolutionized traditional learning methods, making them more interactive and engaging (\cite{prensky2003digital},\cite{tobias2014game}). Python, renowned for its simplicity and versatility, is increasingly used to teach programming, particularly to beginners. This thesis explores the development of implementing Python-based programming games from a gameplay and user experience perspective.
\\\\
The study addresses some key challenges of ensuring the secure execution of Python code through an Angular web app, maintaining performance in a web-based context, and designing user-friendly interfaces that foster an interactive learning experience. By reviewing existing approaches and implementing a prototype environment, this research evaluates the feasibility, scalability, and user-friendliness of such systems.
\\\\
This thesis contributes to the growing field of educational technology, offering insights into developing innovative tools that make programming education more accessible and engaging for learners worldwide. The development also covers the work on the web application to make the new concepts as highly adaptive as possible
