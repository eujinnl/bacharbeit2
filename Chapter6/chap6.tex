\section{Safeguarding against malicious code output}
If the setup for code execution is good, no code should be able to access anything beyond its scope, such as local files, backend, and database. The execution output should only be able to communicate one way and execution can't load or modify other local data files beyond its scope. However, code execution is not the only thing that can be malicious. Post code execution can also change registers, memory, and other processes. This is why it is important to have a good setup for code execution and also to have a good setup for monitoring and logging.
