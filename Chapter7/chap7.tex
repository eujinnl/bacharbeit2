\section{Possible features}
\subsection{A live programming environment}
% we lint it, we parse it, we sandbox it, we rewrite it, we transpile it, we parse it again, we rewrite it more, we instrument it, we transform it into continuation-passing style so we can execute it piecemeal, we transpile it again, we send it over to a Web Worker, we jam it into our World simulation, we run it, and then we serialize the results, the control flow, the execution metrics, and any errors back to the main thread

Emscripten has a virtual file system that allows the user to read and write files. This can be used to store user code and data.
